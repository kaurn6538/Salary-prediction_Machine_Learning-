## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for employee salaries using linear regression. The steps include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Data Preprocessing
Reading the Data: The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame.

Renaming Columns: Columns are renamed for easier access and readability.

Handling Duplicates: Duplicate rows are identified and removed.

Handling Missing Values: Missing values are dropped from the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Overview: The initial structure and summary statistics of the dataset are examined.

Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix is generated to understand relationships between numerical features.

Visualizations:
1.Bar charts to show the distribution of degrees and gender among employees.

2.Histograms and box plots to visualize the distribution of age, experience years, and salary.

## Feature Engineering
*    Label Encoding: Categorical features such as gender, degree, and job title are converted into numerical values using label encoding.
*    Feature Scaling: Numerical features (age and experience years) are standardized using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
## Model Development
*    Splitting the Data: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
*    Training the Model: A linear regression model is trained on the training data.
*    Making Predictions: The trained model is used to predict salaries on the test data.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics:
1. R-squared (RÂ²): Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
   
2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions.
   
3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation.

## Custom Predictions
Custom predictions are made by inputting specific attributes such as age, gender, degree, job title, and years of experience, and using the trained model to predict the salary.

## Results
Model Performance:

1. The R-squared value indicates the model's accuracy.
   
2. The Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error provide insights into the model's prediction errors.
   
3. Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap visualizing the correlation between age, experience years, and salary shows how these features relate to each other.

## Visualizations:
*    Bar charts reveal the distribution of degrees and gender.
*    Histograms and box plots show the distributions of age, experience years, and salary, helping to understand the spread and outliers in the data.
*    This project demonstrates a complete workflow from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model development and evaluation, providing a comprehensive approach to predicting employee salaries based on given features.
